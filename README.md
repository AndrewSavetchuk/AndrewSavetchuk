# Hi there!

I'm a full stack software engineer based in Canada who is passionate about everything related to technology. I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and improve my skills. In my free time, I run my [own blog](https://blog.savetchuk.com/) where I write about interesting things that I learn along the way. When I need to unwind, I usually spend time outside or play video games.
